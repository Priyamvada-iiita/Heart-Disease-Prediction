Evaluating Classifier Performance using PySpark for Cardiovascular Disease Prediction


Cardiovascular disease (CVD) presents a global health challenge, driving proactive interventions. Leveraging IoT devices and big data analytics, this study aims to revolutionize CVD management. Despite complexities in healthcare IoT integration, the potential remains high, addressing data security, privacy, and volume challenges. The methodology employs PySpark for real-time data processing, storage, and analysis, involving preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. Utilizing machine learning models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM, the approach facilitates early detection and management of CVD, promising cost reductions and life preservation.

The paper and ppt attached give a detailed explanantion.
